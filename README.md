# Homework-2
Second Homework Assignment. Responsive Portfolio

I used the same navigation (contained in the "header" section) for each page to keep the navigation consistent.

(Portfolio page is incomplete and still needs work as does the navbar)

# Responsive Portfolio

Create a portfolio site using responsive design to ensure the application will render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

# Approach
I accessed the Bootstrap CSS framework to build a responsive website using mobile first design principles. First step was to set up the three files using the html starter in Bootstrap"

- index.html
- contact.html
- portfolio.html

I utilized the same navigation (nav section) based on Bootstrap Navbar for each page to keep the navigation consistent.

1. Deployed the app to my GitHub repository:

    https://rgsommer777.github.io/Homework-2/

2. Added personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

3. Used a validation service to validate html for any errors (https://validator.w3.org/)

4. Used Bootstrap components and grid system
