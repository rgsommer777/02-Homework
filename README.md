# Homework-2
Second Homework Assignment. Responsive Portfolio

Accessed the Bootstrap CSS framework to build a responsive website using mobile first design principles. First step was to set up the three files using the html starter in Bootstrap"
- index.html
- contact.html
- portfolio.html

I used the same navigation (contained in the "header" section) for each page to keep the navigation consistent.

(Portfolio page is incomplete and still needs work as does the navbar)
